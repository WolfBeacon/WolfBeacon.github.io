            <br>
            <p>TLDR; it's where you spend your summer writing code for awesome open source projects sponsored by Google, making $$$$ and rep along the way. </p>
            <p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together almost 11,000 student participants and 10,000 mentors from over 113 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced over 50 million lines of code for 515 open source organizations.</p>
            <p>As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends">stipend</a> while working in areas related to their interests.</p>
            <p>In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>
            <p>The GSoC programme has produced some amazing Open Source Student Developers across the years, giving them a great deal of respect from their peers and lots of credibility early on in their career often leading to them landing their dream jobs and internships.</p>

            <br>
            <p><em><a href="http://wolfbeacon.com">WolfBeacon</a> is the World's first Open Source Cross-Platform Hackathon Aggregation, Organization &amp; Management Software. Built by Hackers, for Hackers</em>. WolfBeacon streamlines the process of searching for Hackathons and serves as an all-in-one package when it comes to building your own Hackathons.</p>
            <p>Having been built by a diverse and passionate team of university students from across the planet, WolfBeacon aims to provide a seamless experience for both Hackathon Organizers and Hackers so that more developers can become interested in taking their theoretical skills and applying them outside of the classroom. <em>Awareness</em>, <em>Hacking</em> and <em>Community</em> are the pillars WolfBeacon is built on. </p>
            <p>A few salient features (some current, others upcoming) are:</p>
            <div class="container">
                <ul style=" list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>The world's first <a href="https://github.com/wolfbeacon/wolfbeacon-server" target="_blank">API</a> that lists out all the world's Hackathons around you, sorted by distance(default) when you you simply enter your coordinates. </li>

            <p>Thinking about contributing to WolfBeacon? That's great! We're always on the lookout for passionate students, developers, Hackathon Experts and Open-Source Ninjas. A few basic qualities we are looking for in potential GSoC students are:</p>
            <div class="container">
                <ul style=" list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Passionate about about our cause, e.i Hackathons, Hacking, FOSS and Community!</li>
                    <li>Take the time to <em>be detailed</em> and never leave any pixel untouched.</li>
                    <li>Be <em>self motivated</em> and take responsibility your own work.</li>
                    <li>Have <em>strong communication skills</em> and <em>good work ethic</em>.</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>We're not looking for any sort of <em>contract developers</em> or folks who are in it for the short run. We're looking for long term developers who are as excited as we are about WolfBeacon. The GSoC project is only going to be a small part of your journey with us so we'd like you to keep that in mind before you submit a proposal. What's in it for you? We have our own set of exclusive <strong>perks</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="container">
                <ul style=" list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>We have a <em>enviable</em> set of sponsors. They've been gracious enough to offer us their otherwise paid services so we've got access to bleeding edge technologies like Bare Metal High Performance Container Hosting infrastructure by <a href="https://cycle.io">Cycle.io</a>, separate authentication infrastructure <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>, a fully featured <a href="http://jrebel.com/">jRebel</a> license.

            <h3 id="1wolfbeaconanalyticsproject">1. WolfBeacon Analytics Project</h3>
            <p>The main objective of this project is to build a WolfBeacon's Analytics Platform. An integral part of every system in 2017 is the data you can extract from it and manipulate it so that you will be able to provide a better experience for everyone.</p>
            <p>WolfBeacon's Analytics Platform will allow Hackathon Organizers to reach deeper into the interactions and reviews of workshops/ events and the Hackathon itself. With a modern and clean UI paired with UX design strategies, the Analytics Platform will revolutionize the way Hackathons are organized and how feedback is responded to within the coming years. </p>
            <p>We're looking for talented and passionate Front-end developers who will take a mock-up into a full functioning application with their development skills.</p>
            <p><em>Skillset</em>: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>(preferred)/<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. This goes without saying but we expect you to come up with wireframes, prototypes and adhere to all the typical roles that a UI/UX/Frontend developer would normally undertake. Some basic understanding of Analytics/Data Science is a plus but not a requirement per say.</p>

            </p>
            <h3 id="2wolfbeaconbackendproject">2. WolfBeacon Backend Project</h3>
            <p>The WolfBeacon Server forms the Backend and API which is utilised by all the apps . We've also built the world's first API that shows you all the Hackathons around the planet in ascending order of their radial distance on simply entering your coordinates. Well, that's just one of the things that makes the backend so cool</p>
            <p>The challenge is to apply solid software engineering principles and continue work on building a robust, scalable Backend. Initial challenges would involve shifting to the new Auth0 API implementation and using v1 of the Spring Security toolkit provided by Auth0, implementing a CI/CD pipeline integrating the Cycle API which would enable faster deployments to production and including featured Hackathons endpoints, User Hackathons endpoints and profiles with the help of user data from Auth0.</p>
            <p><em>Skillset</em>: JAVA (highly proficient), <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring-Boot</a>, <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, familiarity with <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> and <a href="https://cycle.io">Cycle</a></p>
            <p><strong>Admin:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralphmaamari">Ralph Maamari</a> </p>
            <p><strong>Mentors:</strong> Alex</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Backend project makes for a rather challenging and demanding task since familiarity/experience with the current codebase and all the relevant technologies is a must. We're on a tight deadline and since all the apps are dependent on the Backend, it's imperative that we get tested code into deployment ASAP. With that being said, we're looking forward to proposals from developers with a few solid years of experience and/or those who have already been contributing to WolfBeacon.</p>
