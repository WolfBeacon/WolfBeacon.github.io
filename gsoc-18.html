            <br>
            <p><b>tl;dr</b>: <i>It's this program where you spend your summer writing code for awesome open source projects sponsored by Google while making some $$$$ and rep along the way.</i></p>
            <p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together almost 11,000 student participants and 10,000 mentors from over 113 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced over 50 million lines of code for 515 open source organizations.</p>
            <p>As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends">stipend</a> while working in areas related to their interests.</p>
            <p>In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>
            <p>The GSoC programme has produced some amazing Open Source Student Developers across the years, giving them a great deal of respect from their peers, lots of credibility early on in their career and often leading to them landing their dream jobs and internships.</p>
